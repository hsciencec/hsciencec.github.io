              Decawave DWM1001-DEV board firmware for building ad-hoc distance measurement network. Beluga makes it more convenient for users to create an ad-hoc distance measurement network.
               Users can enter different types of AT commands through serial monitor to configure the properties of the DWM1001-DEV board.
               For example, change the channel of the UWB signal and polling frequency.
               These features enable users to customize their own network setup and meet the requirements.
               Beluga can be applied in the area of localization, robotics, and infrastructure sensing.

              In “Online Data Visualization System” project, the main idea is that users can upload data into a database,
              then the website can extract data from the database to perform data visualization on the website. 
              Users also can choose which database they want to present or which chart type they want to use.
              This system is written mainly by HTML5, Bootstrap, and Chart.js libraries for front-end development,
              Django for back-end development, and combining MySQL for the database.

              Build a custom PCB expansion board connected to STM32F4 Nucleo development board. 
              Developed UART, I2C, SPI, ADC, and LED driver to allow users to collect data from sensors,
               then display values on the LED. Implemented syscalls, context switching, mutexes,
                and rate monotonic scheduler for multi-threaded RTOS from scratch.

              BasPi is designed to detect the water level and water temperature of a bathtub,
               and consists of two parts: the first part uses water level and temperature sensors to detect bathtub water level
                and water temperature, the second part uses the buzzer and LED lights to notify the user.
                Imagine being back home late with an unfinished assignment and at the same time in need of a bath.
                 You are in a dilemma, as it is approaching assignment due time and need to frequently check the bathtub water situation.
                BasPi is an intelligent Bathtub monitoring system, reducing manual checks of bathtub situation to save time.

              It is lovely that computers can assist humans to find objects when people cannot
              find them. In the “Things Finder – An image annotation tool for YOLO3” project,
              the program can help users annotate images easily and saving time. Then, users can
              use the output files from this image annotation program to do further object
              detection projects, for example, helping users to find things they lost.

            Using transfer learning to evaluate building condition

              With the aging of infrastructure, the government and asset managers need to apply more convenient means to evaluate the safety of infrastructure and buildings. 
              The way to evaluate the structure and appearance of infrastructure today is to conduct artificial inspections at regular intervals. 
              Although this method is effective, it takes more time and workforce. 
              This research mainly discusses two directions. 1. Whether transfer learning can be used to effectively evaluate the structure and condition of the building.
               2. Which kind of CNN architecture is more suitable for evaluating the structure and appearance of buildings.
                 Eight different pre-trained models is used to compare the results.
                 Results show that the two CNN architectures NASNetMobile and DenseNet169 have no overfitting phenomenon in the training results, which is more suitable for the evaluation of building structure and appearance.
                  The accuracy of these two models in the test data is around 79%, representing the method mentioned in this article is effective in identifying the condition of infrastructures and can be used in the field of infrastructure assessment for facility managers.
